# Comosol-model-of-fracture-
1. Set the corresponding petrophysical parameters in "Parameters" according to the research needs;
2. Build a geometric model in "Geometry" to simulate the geometry of the fracture medium as needed;
3. Solid Mechanics and Pressure Acoustics for the specific building process of the equations;
4. click on "Compute" in "Study1" to perform the calculation;
5. After waiting for a period of time, you can obtain the stress-strain state of the model, so as to carry out the calculation of decay and dispersion.
